# ESP32 Logic Analyzer

A logic analyzer implementation using the ESP32 microcontroller platform.

## Overview

This project implements a logic analyzer using the ESP32's high-speed GPIO capabilities and internal memory to capture and analyze digital signals. The ESP32's dual-core architecture and built-in WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity make it an ideal platform for a portable, wireless logic analyzer.

## Features (Planned)

- Multi-channel digital signal capture
- High-speed sampling using ESP32's hardware capabilities
- Real-time signal analysis
- Web-based interface for remote monitoring
- WiFi connectivity for wireless operation
- Data export capabilities
- Trigger mechanisms for signal capture

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board (ESP32-DevKitC, ESP32-WROOM-32, or similar)
- Input protection circuitry (optional but recommended)
- Level shifters for non-3.3V signals (if needed)

## Software Requirements

- PlatformIO (recommended) or Arduino IDE
- ESP32 board package

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in PlatformIO
3. Build and upload to your ESP32 device
